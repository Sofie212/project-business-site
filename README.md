# Business Site

A project during Technigo Bootcamp to create a business one pager website that should contain an hero with image, a signup form, and an accordion. 

## The problem

I used a responsive background cover image as top section with position relative and a title and nav-bar with position absolute to bo on-top of hero-image. I modified the accordion with JavaScript and applied the html. form.
